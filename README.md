# EcoGo

## Inspiration
EcoGo was inspired by the urgent need to make our communities aware of the environmental issues we face, in a tangible and impactful way. By converting air quality data into the equivalent number of cigarettes smoked, we provide a stark visualization of pollution levels, encouraging people to take action against air pollution.

## What It Does
EcoGo incentivizes users to reduce their carbon footprints by offering a heatmap of pollution, organizing events for climate action, suggesting eco-friendly routes, and promoting sustainable choices through a leaderboard. The app also helps users find eco-friendly restaurants, shopping locations, and informs them about community initiatives tackling climate change.

## How We Built It
Built during a 24-hour hackathon with sustainability as the cornerstone, EcoGo was developed using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, Firebase for authentication, Google Maps for mapping and geocoding, Firestore for real-time data, and React Native for a cross-platform mobile experience.

## Challenges We Ran Into
We encountered hurdles with real-time pollution data updates, precise geocoding for events, seamless integration of multiple Google APIs, and the steep learning curve of React Native within the tight hackathon deadline.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Our proudest achievement is the MVP which combines a pollution heatmap, an event system, and a user engagement leaderboard. The integration of multiple Google APIs showcases our app's robustness and our commitment to using technology for environmental advocacy.

## What We Learned
This project was a deep dive into how various Google services can be combined to create a powerful tool to promote sustainable living. It also highlighted the importance of user engagement in environmental apps.

## What's Next for EcoGo
We aim to refine EcoGo, adding more interactive elements like location-based pollution alerts, akin to Pokemon Go. We're also planning to integrate more backend features, enhance the user interface, and implement a dynamic description of locations using Google's API.
